    <h3> Where am I going?</h3>


      <p> Alright well that's a tough one. I'm honestly not sure where I'm going in life, are you? <br>

        I joined gSchool because I am very interstred in coding and learning web development. I think it provides a lot of great opportunites and I get work in an ever changing and fast industry. At this point, I'm not sure where I want to work after Galvanize, I'm just excited to be here! </p>

        <p> Honestly, I'd love to be able to travel the world and work at the same time, perhaps this will allow me to do that. Or I'm not sure. There are endless opporunites I feel and I'm open to just about everything. </p>



        <p>
          To learn more about me, see where I've travelled to, some of my photography etc. or if you are simply just curious head over to my personal website <a href="http://www.julesperryman.com"> here. </a>
